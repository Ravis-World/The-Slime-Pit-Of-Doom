# Slime Pit of Doom

A looping, cartoon-style slime animation game made in PenguinMod.

---

## Instructions
Choose a pit type according to the legend in **Notes and Credits**.  
Selecting any other number will immediately reset the game.

Next, decide whether you want grunting and straining dialogue enabled for the character’s feet (default is **No**).

Once started, the game enters an endless loop:
The character’s **bare, blob-shaped feet** struggle and strain in three distinct poses:
- Lifting
- Tap dancing
- Inverting

Thick, cartoon slime clings to the feet and spreads across the floor beneath them.  
Each attempt to escape fails, ending in a dramatic splat before resetting.

On some attempts, the tension can be held for up to **10 seconds of continuous strain** before snapping back.

There is no win condition — the experience is designed as an observation-based animation loop.
